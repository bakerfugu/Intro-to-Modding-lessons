## Fixing the Sheep Breeder 5000!

Can you help fix the Sheep Breeder 5000's code for Rosa? Instead of making new sheep, it just says **"BAAAAaaa"** over and over again!

Rosa tells you that this command will summon a chicken, and she thinks that this will help you.
```javascript
vMod.summon("chicken")
```

Once you can get the Sheep Breeder 5000 to summon lots of sheep, you will be able to move on!
