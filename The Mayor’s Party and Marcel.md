## Will you help with the Mayor's party?

Marcel: “You fixed Rosa’s Sheep Breeder 5000? Awesome! We’re making the tents for the circus that’s coming to the party tomorrow but our builder robot lost their memory! Would you help me teach the builder robot how to make tents?”

Make sure that you are at the campground and you've talked to Marcel before moving on!
